We all face the problem of spams in our inboxes. Let’s build a spam classifier program in python which can tell whether a given message is spam or not! We can do this by using a simple, yet powerful theorem from probability theory called Baye’s Theorem.

We are going to make use of NLTK for processing the messages, WordCloud and matplotlib for visualization and pandas for loading data, NumPy for generating random probabilities for train-test split.

Here we have used the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from Kaggle.
